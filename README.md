**What is Jaeger?**
```
Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system created by Uber Technologies. Itâ€™s used for monitoring and troubleshooting the performance of microservices-based architectures.
It is part of the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) ecosystem, just like Kubernetes and Prometheus.
